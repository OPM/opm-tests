-- This simulation is based on the data given in 
-- 'Ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project:
-- A Reexamination of Black-Oil Simulation',
-- by J.E. Killough,
-- Journal of Petroleum Technology, 1995

-- A dataset from one of the participants was supplied to the 
-- participants of SPE 9. Some of the information in this
-- dataset has been used here as well. 

-- The origin of information or data used in this simulation is 
-- specified in comments. This does not include data whose origin
-- should be obvious to the reader.

-- Item 1: datum depth (ft)

-- 	   - Killough says initial oil phase pressure is
--	   - 3600psia at depth 9035ft
-- Item 3: depth of water-oil contact (ft)
-- 	   - Given to be 9950 ft in Killough's paper

-- 	   - Given to be 0 in Killough's dataset
-- 	   - 0 in SPE2
-- Item 5: depth of gas-oil contact (ft)
--	   - 8800ft in Killough's dataset
-- Item 6: gas-oil capillary pressure at gas-oil contact (psi)
-- 	   - Given to be 0 in Killough's dataset

-- Item 7: RSVD-table
-- Item 8: RVVD-table
-- Item 9: OPM only supports item 9 equal to zero.

RSVD
-- The initial oil phase pressure is given to be 3600psia, at
-- which the GOR is 1.39 Mscf per stb according to Killough's table 2.
-- Since there is no free gas initially present*, the oil
-- phase (with dissolved gas) must initially have a constant GOR as
-- a function of depth through the reservoir (at the given pressure)
	8800 1.39
	9950 1.39 /
-- *)
--   This is explicitly stated in Killough's paper.
--   Note that the initial oil phase pressure is the same as
--   the saturation (bubble point) pressure of the oil.
--   This should also imply that there is no free gas initially present.
--   Since there is no free gas initially present, the gas-oil
--   contact should lie above the reservoir, which it does (EQUIL, item 5)
