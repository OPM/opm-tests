## ACTIONX Tests Using the MODEL02 Model   
This case has standard wells, 3 producers and 2 injectors. Well OP03 has modified completions compared to the base case model
and the water oil contact of equilibrium region 2 has been moved to get a stronger well water cut development.
 1) Production wells with preferred phase (OIL, GAS)
    PROD1 - OIL
    PROD2 - OIL
    PROD3 - GAS
 2) Injection wells with preferred phase (GAS, WATER)
    INJ1 - WATER
    INJ2 - GAS
    Note that both injection wells inject both gas and water at various times.
 3) All wells get their PI values adjusted at least once, with wells PROD2, PROD3 and INJ2 getting their PI adjusted an extra
    time and wells PROD1 and INJ1 having their PI adjusted at the same time as the well is opened.
 4) Well PROD3 has modified completions compared to the base case model.
 5) The water oil contact of equilibrium region 2 has been moved to get a stronger well water cut development.

### ACTIONX_COMPDAT Description and Results
The model has been modified to test the COMPDAT keyword with the ACTIONX keyword, as follows:
 1) The case is based on with the input deck re-factored to match the manual style, and with the well declarations declared at
    the beginning of the run.
 2) ACTIONX COMPLUMP - PROD2 completions are defined in ACT-01, instead of the deck and ACT02 opens completion 2, well is opened
                       in the deck.
 3) ACTIONX COMPLUMP - INJ1 completions are defined in ACT-01 and ACT-04 shuts completion 1 and opens completion 2.
 4) ACTIONX COMPDAT -  PROD1 connections 09-10, INJ1 connections 08-11 defined in ACT-01.
 5) ACTIONX COMPDAT -  PROD2 connections 10-11 defined in ACT-02.
 6) ACTIONX COMPDAT -  PROD3 connections 07-10 connections defined in ACT-03.

### ACTIONX_COMPLUMP Description and Results
The model has been modified to test the COMPLUMP keyword with the ACTIONX keyword, as follows:
 1) The case is based on  with the input deck re-factored to match the manual style, and with the well declarations declared at
    the beginning of the run.
 2) ACTIONX COMPLUMP - PROD2 completions are defined in ACT-01, instead of the deck and ACT02 opens completion 2, well is opened
                       in the deck.
 3) ACTIONX COMPLUMP - INJ1 completions are defined in ACT-01 and ACT-03 shuts completion 1 and opens completion 2.

The results should therefore be identical to the original case, ../model2/0B_WELPI_MODEL2.DATA.

### ACTIONX_GCONINJE Description and Results
The model tests the use of the ACTIONX and GCONINJE keywords to control gas and water injection rates.
 1) Production wells with preferred phase (OIL, GAS)
    OP01  - OIL
    OP02  - OIL
    OP03  - OIL (Completion 2)
 2) Injection wells with preferred phase (GAS, WATER)
    GI01 - GAS
    WI01 - WAT
 3) ACTIONX GCONINJE - Re-inject 0.95 of produced gas up 200e3 m3/day
 4) ACTIONX GCONINJE - Voidage replacement with makeup water with maximum 4000 m3/day.

### ACTIONX_GCONPROD Description and Results
The model tests the use of the ACTIONX and GCONPROD keywords to control gas production. This run is a depletion case, with no
pressure support from the producers or injectors.
 1) Production wells with preferred phases.
    OP01  - OIL
    OP02  - OIL
    OP03  - OIL (Completion 2)
 2) Injection wells with preferred phases.
    GI01 - GAS (not active)
    WI01 - WAT (not active)
 3) ACTIONX GCONPROD - Set max gas rate for when GOR >= 150 m3/m3.
 4) ACTIONX GCONPROD - Once GOR >= 200 m3/m3 cut back gas rate by UDA variable.
 5) ACTIONX GCONPROD - Once FOPR <= 500 then convert to gas field.
 6) ACTIONX WCONPROD - Gas field minimum gas rate of 50E3 m3/day then shut-in all wells and exit.

### ACTIONX_GCONSUMP Description and Results
The model tests the use of the ACTIONX and the GCONSUMP keyword to consume fuel at various stages. In addition, the GCONPROD
keyword is employed to control gas production. This run is a prediction depletion case, with no pressure support from the
producers or injectors, and with the field converted to a gas field operation with the ACTIONX ACT-02 block.
 1) Production wells with preferred phases.
    OP01  - OIL
    OP02  - OIL
    OP03  - OIL (Completion 2)
 2) Injection wells with preferred phases.
    GI01 - GAS (not active)
    WI01 - WAT (not active)
 3) ACTIONX GCONSUMP - Set max gas rate for when GOR >= 150 m3/m3 and increase gas consumption.
 4) ACTIONX GCONSUMP - Once GOR >= 200 m3/m3 and OPR <=1500 m3/d then convert to gas field with increased gas consumption.

Although the case runs, we are unable to check the gas sales and fuel gas consumption volumes as the required summary vectors
are currently not written out.

### ACTIONX_GRUPTREE Description and Results
The model tests the use of the ACTIONX and GRUPTREE keywords to switch wells to different groups, together with group controls
and controlling gas and water injection rates.
 1) Production wells with preferred phase (OIL, GAS)

### ACTIONX_WELPI Description and Results
The model has been modified to test the WELPI keyword with the ACTIONX keyword, as follows:
 1) The input deck has been re-factored to match the manual style, and with the well declarations declared at the beginning of
    the run.
 2) Instead of the well productivity indices being modified in the deck, they are implemented via the ACTIONX keyword instead
     (ACT-01 to ACT-04). The results should therefore be identical to the original case ../model2/0B_WELPI_MODEL2.DATA.

### ACTIONX_WPIMULT Description and Results
The model has been modified to test the WPIMULT keyword with the ACTIONX keyword, as follows:
 1) The input deck has been re-factored to match the manual style, and with the well declarations declared at the beginning of
    the run.
 2) For this case, instead of the well productivity indices being modified in the deck, they are implemented via the ACTIONX
     keyword (ACT-01 to ACT04), using the WPIMULT keyword. The multipliers are derived from the WELPI none productivity case
     divided by the WELPI base case run. Thus, results should therefore be close/identical to the original WELPI case.

## ACTIONX Tests Using the MODEL05 Model 
The model employs Gas Lift with no optimization via the setting a constant gas lift value via the WELTARG keyword, as well
using GCONINJE(GUIPHASE) equal to NETV. NETV defines that guide rates for the group injection and is set according to the groups
net reservoir voidage rate. The model has a total of five oil producers and four water injectors, as well as various groups 
as shown below:

## ACTIONX Tests Using the SPE09 Model   
This simulation is based on the data given in Ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project:

   "A Reexamination of Black-Oil Simulation", by J.E. Killough, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 1995

A data set from one of the participants was supplied to the participants of SPE 9. Some of the information in this
data set has been used here as well. The origin of information or data used in this simulation is specified in comments.
This does not include data whose origin - should be obvious to the reader.

Note:  
 1) This version users a Cartesian Regular Grid; however, OPM Flow does not have an OLDTRAN option that is normally used
     with this type of grid. This means that OPM Flow users the NEWTRAN transmissibility calculation instead, that is
     normally used to calculate the transmissibilities Corner Point Geometry grids. 
 2) NEWTRAN has been added to this input deck but is not required as OPM Flow only has this option.
 3) This is the corner-point geometry version of SPE09.

## ACTIONX Tests Using the WSEGVALV Model   
The WSEGVALV model is a test case for modeling an Inflow Control Devise ("ICD") for multi-segment wells using the WSEGVALV
keyword in the SCHEDULE section. In addition the COMPSEGS and WELSEGS keywords are used to define PROD1 the single multi-segment 
well in the model.  The grid is a simple (12, 5, 10) in the (x, y, z) dimensions and has one well (PROD1). All three phases are 
active, but only the oil and water phases are initially present.
