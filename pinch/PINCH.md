**Currently, OPM Flow does not support PINCH(PINCHOPT) equal to NOGAP; thus, these tests map used for when the option
has been implemented.**

**Notes:** 

1. _Test Type_ column shows if the case is used for integration testing (_Int_), or regression testing (_Reg_).  
2. _Results Match_ column indicate if the OPM Flow results match the commercial simulator.

### PINCH5 Model (Cartesian Regular Grid) Description and Results

The model is a simple (1, 1, 5) model with five vertically stacked cells, no MINPV and no PINCH directives included.
It is meant as a base case to verify the grid and grid transmissibilities, and compare with the other PINCH5 test 
cases.

### PINCH_MULTZ_ALL Description and Results
PINCH(PINCHMUL) equal to ALL, which results in the pinch-out transmissibility being calculated from the minimum value 
of the MULTZ of the active cell at the top of the pinch-out and all the inactive cells in the pinch-out vertical
column. Here, MULTZ is set to 1.0 
```
MULTZ
 19*1.0 /
PINCH
     1*      'GAP'     1*  'TOPBOT'  'ALL'  / --default values
```

### PINCH_MULTZ-_ALL Description and Results  
Same as PINCH_MULTZ_ALL, but using MULTZ- instead, that is:
```
MULTZ-
 19*1.0 /
PINCH
     1*      'GAP'     1*  'TOPBOT'  'ALL'  / --default values
```

### PINCH_MULTZ_ALL_BARRIER Description and Results  
PINCH(PINCHMUL) equal to ALL, which results in the pinch-out transmissibility being calculated from the minimum value 
of the MULTZ of the active cell at the top of the pinch-out and all the inactive cells in the pinch-out vertical
column. Here, MULTZ is set to 1.0, except layer 10 where MULTZ is set equal 0.0 to enable a barrier.
```

### PINCH_NONE Description and Results
Drogon synthetic reservoir model.

No results as the case fails to run due to ENDSCALE(DIRECT) set to DIRECT as only the default value of NODIR is 
supported, as well as PCW and PCG keywords also not supported.

**Not Documented and No Results**
