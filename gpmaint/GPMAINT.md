### GPMAINT Model Description  (Regular Corner-Point)

Lower Reservoir
![](plots/gpmain-model-lower-ternary.jpg)
Lower Reservoir FIPAREAS
![](plots/gpmain-model-lower-fip.jpg)

This model is based MODEL04 and consists of a (30, 15, 13) Regular Corner-Point Grid, with two separate reservoirs: an Upper
Reservoir (layers 1 - 6), a Shale Inactive Layer (7), and a Lower Reservoir (layers 8 - 13). In addition, the FIPNUM array has
been introduced to identify the two reservoirs, together with two FIPxxxxx arrays, FIPLAYER and FIPAREAS. The former is
identical to the FIPNUM array, whereas, the latter breaks each reservoir into three separate reporting regions, resulting in six
FIP regions.

There are a total of 12 oil producers and eight water injection wells, and all wells using the multi segment well model. Secondly
the surface network has been changed, so that wells OPL1, WID1 and WID2 now all belong to the same group, LOWEAST, and
consequently, AQF group has been removed, as shown below:

```

                         ------+------            +------+-------------+

             ---+--+-----+-----+-----+

            OPU1  OPU2  OPU3  WIU1  WIU2
```
In the above figure the UPPER reservoir wells have been renamed for a gas-oil reservoir as follows:
1) WIU1 in group NW has been renamed to OPUW1,
2) WIU2 in group NW has been renamed to OPUW2,
3) WIU3 in group NE has been renamed to OPUW3,
4) WIU4 in group SE has been renamed to OPUW4,
5) OPU1 in group NW has been renamed to GIU1,
6) OPU5 in group NE has been renamed to GIU5, and
7) OPU7 in group SE has been renamed to GIU7,

since the Upper reservoir is now a gas-oil reservoir.

The model is used to test the GPMAINT keyword using different configurations of the keyword and the various FIP regions.
